We dont walk anymore we just get in our cars and go. What most people dont see is how it can cause damage to the people and the environment. Cars can be used for good and bad situations in our economy. Their are many advantages and disadvantages to limiting vehicle usage.\\n\\nLimiting car usage could benefit people in many ways. The Vauban suburban community lives without their cars and only use them when necessary or if they have the permit to use them. A mother, Heidrun Walter says, \\\"When i had a car i was allways tense. I'm muchhappier this way.\\\" she was happy with the way her life was going without a vehicle it wasnt as stressful to her. In \\\"German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\\\", it says \\\"Having less vehicles made the suburbs more accessible to public transportation\\\" this makes everything they build walking distance and everything is closer together, they dont have to use major highways so they can get to a store. It also says, \\\"many suburbs are starting to resemble Vauban, closer together and have less car owners in the developing world\\\" this kind of example is leading the world to use less vehicles which would mean less pollution. Another advantage of limiting car usage would be more people are getting together and having more social interactions. In the exerpt from \\\"Paris bans driving due to smog\\\" it says, \\\"The congestion was down 60 percent in the capitol of France.\\\" this means the roads weren't as backed up and busy. Their is beginning to be a change in the world as less people use their automotive. When Bogota, Columbia did the Day Without Cars the people would walk where they need to get or rode their bicycle. Carlos Arturo Plaza rode his bicycle and said \\\"Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\\\" people like being able to help their economy. In \\\"The End of Car Culture\\\" it says, \\\"it will have beneficial implications for carbon emmisions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions\\\" which means the economy will be in a better place.\\n\\nTheir is also disadvantages of why limiting car usage could be bad for the world. If they're not able to use their car to get to their job or get grocerys how can people be okay? They are getting fined to do what is need for them to survive. \\\"Delivery companies complained of lost revenue\\\" it says in \\\"Paris bans driving in the smog\\\". Delivery trucks cant do their job if they know they will be fined for being out on the roads without it being their designated day. \\\"American's are buying less cars and young adults arent getting their liscense as quick\\\" says, \\\"the End of Car Culture\\\". Which means more vehicle industrys are getting less buyers and are having to come up with a \\\"broader product\\\".\\n\\nClearly the world is better off with limited car uasge. It's better for the economy, better for the people, and the environment. They're are more resources for agood reason to cut down on our worlds car usage but their is also the few disadvantages as to why it could be bad.\",\n          \"Everyday a great many people drive their cars to commute to work, run errands, and sometimes drive their cars for career related purposes. Little do they know that the greenhousee gas emissions that their automobiles create are damaging the environment and creating large amounts of pollution in metropolitan areas. To help reduce the gas emmisions caused by automobiles many countries around the world have created programs and communities that are designed to lessen the amount of car usage in the areas that they are employed in. In doing so they have reduced the amount of greenhousee gasses in Earth's atmosphere along with producing many other benefits.\\n\\nOf all the advantages of limited car usage the most attractive one would definetely have to be reduced pollution and greenhousee gas emissions. Not only will people save money on fuel in communities that forbid the usage of cars but they will save the planet as well. According to the article \\\"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\\\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal \\\"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States.\\\" The information shows that a large amount of gas emissions can be produced by automobiles. Assume that there were a lot of cities that had incredibly low rates of car usage. If those city's greenhouse gas emission levels were compared to those of an average car filled city then it would be logical that the carfree city produced less greenhousee gasses.\\n\\nAnother positive change that has the ability to happen in cities and communities that limit their car usage is that municipal development can occur. When people start to use cars less and less then businesses would most likely move to more accessible locations which in turn may give the businesses more customers. Due to the increased business in certain stores, stores from different companies will likely move in to areas in and around the one the other businesses reside in to drum up their sales as well. The article \\\"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\\\" supports my statement in the with the sentence, \\\"Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\\\" The sentence shows the correlation between lessening car usage and municipal development.\\n\\nIn the end, the advantages of limiting car usage are as bountiful as fish in the ocean. From lessening the amount of pollution in cities to aiding the development of cities, limiting car usage can do great things.\",\n          \"Provide a step-by-step guide on history of mathematics in the context of business strategy.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"generated\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "\n",
            "1. **Structure and Organization**:\n",
            "   - **Human Writing**: Typically follows a more flexible and organic structure, with an emphasis on storytelling, emotion, and personal experiences. Human writers can use various literary devices, such as metaphors, similes, and anecdotes, to engage readers.\n",
            "   - **AI Writing**: Tends to be more structured and formulaic, often adhering to specific templates or patterns. AI writing may lack the nuanced storytelling and emotional depth found in human writing, as it primarily relies on data-driven patterns and statistical language models.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Vocabulary and Style**:\n",
            "   - **Human Writing**: Utilizes a diverse and creative vocabulary, often incorporating idiomatic expressions, colloquialisms, and regional dialects. Human writers can adapt their style to suit the intended audience, purpose, and genre.\n",
            "   - **AI Writing**: Generally relies on a more limited and factual vocabulary, drawing from the data it was trained on. AI writing may struggle with idiomatic expressions, colloquialisms, and regional dialects, as these often require cultural and contextual understanding.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Consistency and Coherence**:\n",
            "   - **Human Writing**: Can exhibit variations in tone, style, and voice, depending on the writer's intentions and the subject matter. Human writers can maintain coherence while incorporating different perspectives and viewpoints.\n",
            "   - **AI Writing**: Aims for consistency and coherence by adhering to predefined parameters and patterns. While AI writing can maintain a uniform tone and style, it may struggle with integrating diverse viewpoints or adapting to complex, multifaceted topics.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Factual Accuracy and Creativity**:\n",
            "   - **Human Writing**: Balances factual accuracy with creative expression, often weaving facts into engaging narratives or using imaginative scenarios to illustrate concepts. Human writers can critically evaluate information and incorporate personal insights.\n",
            "   - **AI Writing**: Primarily focuses on factual accuracy, as it relies on the data it was trained on. AI writing may struggle with creative expression, as it lacks personal experiences and emotions to draw upon.\n",

            "output: AI writing has made significant strides in recent years, often producing content that is coherent, grammatically correct, and contextually relevant. However, it still falls short of human-level writing in several key areas:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Creativity and Originality**: AI models generate text based on patterns they've learned from vast datasets. They lack the human capacity for original thought, personal experiences, and imaginative leaps. AI might struggle to create truly novel ideas or narratives, often relying on established tropes or clichés.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Emotional Depth and Nuance**: AI writing can describe emotions and convey basic sentiments but often lacks the depth and subtlety that human writers bring. It may fail to capture complex emotional landscapes, empathize genuinely, or use language to evoke specific feelings in readers.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Cultural Understanding and Context**: AI models are trained on text data and may not fully grasp cultural intricacies, historical contexts, or the subtleties of language that vary across different regions and communities. This can lead to misinterpretations or insensitive representations.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Critical Thinking and Argumentation**: While AI can summarize existing arguments or present factual information, it struggles with forming, evaluating, and presenting complex arguments or engaging in critical discourse. It doesn't possess the ability to question assumptions, weigh evidence, or engage in debate in the same way humans do.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Adaptability and Flexibility**: Human writers can adjust their style, tone, and content based on real-time feedback or changing contexts with ease. AI writing systems, on the other hand, require explicit instructions or retraining to adapt to new styles or subjects, making them less flexible in dynamic writing scenarios.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Ethical and Moral Judgment**: AI writing lacks the ability to make ethical judgments or understand moral implications. It cannot inherently recognize or avoid biases in its outputs, requiring human oversight to mitigate such issues.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Interpersonal Skills**: Human writing often involves understanding and responding to the needs or expectations of a specific audience. AI writing can struggle with tailoring content to specific readers or understanding the nuances of interpersonal communication, such as sarcasm, humor, or unspoken cues\n"
