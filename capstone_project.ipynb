We dont walk anymore we just get in our cars and go. What most people dont see is how it can cause damage to the people and the environment. Cars can be used for good and bad situations in our economy. Their are many advantages and disadvantages to limiting vehicle usage.\\n\\nLimiting car usage could benefit people in many ways. The Vauban suburban community lives without their cars and only use them when necessary or if they have the permit to use them. A mother, Heidrun Walter says, \\\"When i had a car i was allways tense. I'm muchhappier this way.\\\" she was happy with the way her life was going without a vehicle it wasnt as stressful to her. In \\\"German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\\\", it says \\\"Having less vehicles made the suburbs more accessible to public transportation\\\" this makes everything they build walking distance and everything is closer together, they dont have to use major highways so they can get to a store. It also says, \\\"many suburbs are starting to resemble Vauban, closer together and have less car owners in the developing world\\\" this kind of example is leading the world to use less vehicles which would mean less pollution. Another advantage of limiting car usage would be more people are getting together and having more social interactions. In the exerpt from \\\"Paris bans driving due to smog\\\" it says, \\\"The congestion was down 60 percent in the capitol of France.\\\" this means the roads weren't as backed up and busy. Their is beginning to be a change in the world as less people use their automotive. When Bogota, Columbia did the Day Without Cars the people would walk where they need to get or rode their bicycle. Carlos Arturo Plaza rode his bicycle and said \\\"Its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\\\" people like being able to help their economy. In \\\"The End of Car Culture\\\" it says, \\\"it will have beneficial implications for carbon emmisions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions\\\" which means the economy will be in a better place.\\n\\nTheir is also disadvantages of why limiting car usage could be bad for the world. If they're not able to use their car to get to their job or get grocerys how can people be okay? They are getting fined to do what is need for them to survive. \\\"Delivery companies complained of lost revenue\\\" it says in \\\"Paris bans driving in the smog\\\". Delivery trucks cant do their job if they know they will be fined for being out on the roads without it being their designated day. \\\"American's are buying less cars and young adults arent getting their liscense as quick\\\" says, \\\"the End of Car Culture\\\". Which means more vehicle industrys are getting less buyers and are having to come up with a \\\"broader product\\\".\\n\\nClearly the world is better off with limited car uasge. It's better for the economy, better for the people, and the environment. They're are more resources for agood reason to cut down on our worlds car usage but their is also the few disadvantages as to why it could be bad.\",\n          \"Everyday a great many people drive their cars to commute to work, run errands, and sometimes drive their cars for career related purposes. Little do they know that the greenhousee gas emissions that their automobiles create are damaging the environment and creating large amounts of pollution in metropolitan areas. To help reduce the gas emmisions caused by automobiles many countries around the world have created programs and communities that are designed to lessen the amount of car usage in the areas that they are employed in. In doing so they have reduced the amount of greenhousee gasses in Earth's atmosphere along with producing many other benefits.\\n\\nOf all the advantages of limited car usage the most attractive one would definetely have to be reduced pollution and greenhousee gas emissions. Not only will people save money on fuel in communities that forbid the usage of cars but they will save the planet as well. According to the article \\\"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\\\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal \\\"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States.\\\" The information shows that a large amount of gas emissions can be produced by automobiles. Assume that there were a lot of cities that had incredibly low rates of car usage. If those city's greenhouse gas emission levels were compared to those of an average car filled city then it would be logical that the carfree city produced less greenhousee gasses.\\n\\nAnother positive change that has the ability to happen in cities and communities that limit their car usage is that municipal development can occur. When people start to use cars less and less then businesses would most likely move to more accessible locations which in turn may give the businesses more customers. Due to the increased business in certain stores, stores from different companies will likely move in to areas in and around the one the other businesses reside in to drum up their sales as well. The article \\\"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\\\" supports my statement in the with the sentence, \\\"Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rushhour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\\\" The sentence shows the correlation between lessening car usage and municipal development.\\n\\nIn the end, the advantages of limiting car usage are as bountiful as fish in the ocean. From lessening the amount of pollution in cities to aiding the development of cities, limiting car usage can do great things.\",\n          \"Provide a step-by-step guide on history of mathematics in the context of business strategy.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"generated\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            " To evaluate the performance of machine learning and generative AI models in distinguishing between human and AI-written text from the 'balanced_ai_human_prompt.csv' dataset, we would need to follow these steps:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Data Preparation**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the models, while the testing set is used to evaluate their performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Model Training**: Train machine learning and generative AI models on the prepared training data. This could include various models like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), or Transformer-based models like BERT.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Prediction**: Use the trained models to predict whether each sample in the testing set is written by a human or an AI.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Calculate the following metrics to assess the models' performance:\n",
            "\n",
            "   - **Accuracy**: The ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. It gives an overall idea of how often the classifier correctly predicts the class.\n",
            "\n",
            "   - **Precision**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations (true positives) to the total predicted positives (true positives + false positives). It measures the accuracy of positive predictions.\n",
            "\n",
            "   - **Recall (Sensitivity)**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations (true positives) to the actual positives (true positives + false negatives). It measures the classifier's ability to find all the relevant cases.\n",
            "\n",
            "   - **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a single metric that balances both precision and recall, offering a more nuanced evaluation than accuracy alone, especially in imbalanced datasets.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Interpretation**: Analyze the metrics to understand the models' strengths and weaknesses. High accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score indicate a robust model. However, context matters: for instance, in a scenario where minimizing false negatives (missing AI-generated texts) is crucial, a model with high recall would be preferred, even if it has slightly lower precision.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Comparison**: Compare the performance of different models to identify which one performs best for this specific task. Generative AI models, especially those based on Transformer architectures, often show superior performance in text classification tasks due to their ability to capture complex linguistic patterns.\n",
